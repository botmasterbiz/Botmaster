On April 8th, 2025, at 7:30 a.m., a toolbox talk was led by Brandon Butler, introducing the new FLAHA process in the WorkEase app, aimed at improving field level hazard assessment documentation, supporting safety compliance, and enhancing audit readiness. The update entails a digital FLAHA upload process requiring onsite filling, photographing, and uploading of the flaha forms to the WorkEase app after completing the job. This process is crucial for keeping FLAHAs tied to job records, ensuring time savings, improving office reviews and audit accuracy, and reinforcing safety compliance. The meeting underscored the necessity of hard copies, new PPE form completion, and weekly vehicle inspections. The talk concluded at 7:37 a.m., after which the floor was opened for any questions or concerns.
